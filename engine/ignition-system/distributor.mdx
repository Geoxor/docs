Distributors are a key component in the ignition system, it's purpose is to direct spark to the appropriate cylinders with the correct firing-order

The distributor connects mechanically to rotating assembly of the engine and is a timed component

Distributors can be rotated to advance or retard the **base** ignition-timing using a timing light

<Warning>
  Advancing the ignition timing should happen with caution as it **may lead to potential knock** if ambient air temperatures are too hot and/or the fuel used being of low octane rating
</Warning>

<Note>
  Advancing or retarding the ignition timing does not set a static degree * timing on the engine, the ECU uses an ignition map that references relative to the base timing
