## Identifying bad sparkplugs

Worn-out sparkplugs may bring up these issues

- Misfiring
- Reduced fuel efficiency
- Increased emissions
- Potential engine damage
- Difficulty starting

## Types

### Iridium

These spark plugs are usually used in turbo applications and last for around `~150.000km` though they may last less for performance engines with high demands

<Note>
  Iridium spark plugs always have one electrode

### Copper

Copper sparkplugs are the cheapest they usually need to be changed along with the typical engine maintenance, they last for around `~20.000km`

<Note>
  Copper plugs may have up to 4 electrodes
</Note>

## Electrodes

Some sparkplugs have multiple electrodes, having more helps with durability so they last longer and with fouling protection but reduce ignitability

<Info>
  Having multiple electrodes doesn't mean that there will be multiple sparks happening, there's always gonna be one spark on one of the electrodes which is determined by the path of least resistence
